The Sorting Hat will place you into your house.
Now, while you are in RPL, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup.

To be sorted into your house, clone this repository. Run python from the root of this repsitory and call `SortingHat.py` with python3.
